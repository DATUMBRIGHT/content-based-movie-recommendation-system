## Movie Recommender System: README.md

This document outlines a movie recommendation system built using a neural network. The core idea is to learn a vector representation (embedding) for each movie, capturing its essential characteristics.  These embeddings enable the system to recommend movies based on similarity or user preferences.

### Project Overview

The project involves building a recommendation system that takes a movie title as input and outputs a list of similar movies. The system is based on a neural network trained with triplet loss to learn a feature embedding for each movie. The system also includes an image download and integration component, suggesting the potential for incorporating visual features in the recommendation process. 

**Key components of the system:**

*   **Data Preparation:**
    *   Extracting information such as cast, crew, keywords, genres, and plot overviews. 
    *   Preprocessing the data, handling missing values, and transforming data types. 
    *   Creating a comprehensive movie description by combining various features. 
*   **Feature Embeddings:**
    *   Although the specific features used are not explicitly described in the sources, the system relies on representing each movie as a feature vector.
*   **Neural Network Model:**
    *   A feedforward neural network with linear layers, ReLU activation, and dropout is employed to process input embeddings and produce output embeddings.
*   **Triplet Loss Function:**
    *   The model is trained with a triplet loss function, which aims to minimize the distance between embeddings of similar movies while maximizing the distance between dissimilar ones.
*   **Image Integration:**
    *   The system includes functionality to download movie posters or stills, indicating the possibility of using visual features to enhance recommendations, potentially using CNNs.
*   **Recommendation Search:**
    *   A dedicated class, `Recommendation_Search`, handles the retrieval of recommendations based on cosine similarity between movie embeddings.
*   **Evaluation:**
    *   The system is evaluated using metrics such as Top-1 Cosine Similarity and Genre Accuracy.

### Code Structure and Functionality

The code snippets provided offer insights into the various functions used in this project:

**Data Preprocessing:**

*   **`extract_names(data)`:** Extracts names of genres, companies, or keywords from data using regular expressions.
*   **`preprocess(df)`:** Handles various data preprocessing tasks, including:
    *   Converting numeric columns.
    *   Replacing zero values with the mean.
    *   Filling missing values in web pages.
    *   Converting release dates to datetime format.
*   **`clean()`:** Cleans overview and tagline columns using regular expressions.
*   **`extract_cast(data)`:** Extracts cast information from data using regular expressions.
*   **`process_description(text)`:** Cleans the combined movie description by removing special characters and non-alphanumeric characters.
*   **`list_to_text(text)`:** Converts a list of text elements into a single string.

**Model Training and Evaluation:**

*   **`Movie_Dataset(Dataset)`:** A custom dataset class for handling movie data and labels (movie titles).
    *   **`__repr__()`:** Returns information about the dataset.
    *   **`train_test_split(train_ratio=0.8)`:** Splits the dataset into training and test sets.
*   **`RecommenderSystem(nn.Module)`:** The neural network model for the recommender system.
    *   The specific architecture of the model, including layers and activation functions, is not fully described in the sources. 
*   **`get_movie_index(movie, df)`:** Retrieves the index of a movie in a DataFrame based on its title.
*   **`Evaluate_metrics`:** A class for evaluating the performance of the trained model.
    *   The specific metrics calculated by this class are not fully detailed in the sources, but mentions of "Top-1 Cosine Similarity" and "Genre Accuracy" suggest attempts to evaluate embedding similarity and genre prediction accuracy.

**Image Handling:**

*   **`download_all_pics(path)`:** Downloads images for movies in the test set, organizing them into a folder structure.
*   The sources provide numerous examples of image download logs, showing the URLs and file paths of the downloaded images.

**Recommendation Search and Interface:**

*   **`Recommendation_Search`:** A class responsible for handling the recommendation search process.
    *   **`create_df()`:** Creates a subset DataFrame from the test data and identifies missing indices.
    *   The class utilizes the model's predictions (movie embeddings) and image data to generate recommendations. 
*   **`get_recommendations`:**  Retrieves recommendations based on user input (movie title).
    *   This function likely uses cosine similarity to identify similar movies based on their embeddings.
